## Background 

### The SHA-256 algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed-size output, or hash, from any input data. 

* It is a member of the SHA-2 family of hash functions, which were developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States. 

* SHA-256 is used in various applications, including digital signatures, password storage, and blockchain technology. 

* It works by taking an input message and processing it through a series of mathematical operations to produce a unique 256-bit hash value. 

* The security of SHA-256 is based on its resistance to collision attacks, which means that it is practically impossible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.

* This reportprovides an in-depth analysis of the SHA-256 algorithm, including its history, design, implementation, and security properties.

* We also discuss some of the potential weaknesses andattacks that have been discovered in SHA-256, as well as its strengths and advantages over other hash functions. Overall.
  
* SHA-256 is a highly secure and reliable encryption algorithm that plays a crucial role in modern cryptography.
