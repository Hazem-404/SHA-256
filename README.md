## Background 

The SHA-256 algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed-size 
output, or hash, from any input data. It is a member of the SHA-2 family of hash functions, which 
were developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States. SHA-256 is used in 
various applications, including digital signatures, password storage, and blockchain technology. It 
works by taking an input message and processing it through a series of mathematical operations 
to produce a unique 256-bit hash value. The security of SHA-256 is based on its resistance to 
collision attacks, which means that it is practically impossible to find two different messages that 
produce the same hash value. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the SHA-256 
algorithm, including its history, design, implementation, and security properties. We also discuss 
some of the potential weaknesses and attacks that have been discovered in SHA-256, as well as 
its strengths and advantages over other hash functions. Overall, SHA-256 is a highly secure and 
reliable encryption algorithm that plays a crucial role in modern cryptography
